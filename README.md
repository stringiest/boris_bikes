# Boris Bikes Challenge

Transport for London want to deliver a new bike system, with a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use.

The challenge is to build a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality.

## Motivation
This project formed part of the week one challenges for Makers Academy.

## Features
When a person wants to use a bike, the docking station will release it.
When a person wants to use a bike, it will be working.
